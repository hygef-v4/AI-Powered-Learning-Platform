# AI-DLC State Tracking

## Current source/documentation baseline — 2026-10-30

- Project origin: Greenfield, started 2026-09-12; current task: approved audit remediation, Student MCP restoration and documentation synchronization.
- Source: `staging@794a405304bf02dd2593a9fa2c88662d7cd52845`; 66 active UC, 50 MVP stories + 1 extension, 15 logical units.
- Current scoped stage: code/test/document remediation and fresh local Build and Test complete. Earlier doc sync preserved. Student MCP restored for UC41; Admin MCP removed; no deployment. User requested direct execution without further subagents.
- Source-observed means code exists; full application acceptance, fresh CI/runtime/provider/security/performance/restore effectiveness remain pending.
- [Execution plan](inception/plans/2026-10-30-aidlc-doc-sync-plan.md), [traceability](inception/reverse-engineering/doc-code-traceability.md), [decision register](inception/reverse-engineering/decision-register.md).

## Extension Configuration

| Extension | Enabled | Decided At |
|---|---|---|
| Security Baseline | Yes | Requirements Analysis; scope retained |
| Resiliency Baseline | Yes | Requirements Analysis; scope retained |
| Property-Based Testing | No | Requirements Analysis; unchanged |

Security scope: SECURITY-03/04/05/08/09/12/15. Resiliency scope: RESILIENCY-04/06/10. Other controls N/A outside approved project scope. Automated authorization/privacy/resiliency regressions passed within the approved remediation scope; this does not certify every runtime control. Key-reveal design delta remains explicit.

## Historical lifecycle and approvals

[Full pre-sync state, approvals, dated test counts and pending issues](history/aidlc-state-before-2026-10-30-sync.md). This archive preserves the previous content including date-specific implementation notes; stale unit names/statuses there are historical. Audit remains append-only in [audit.md](audit.md). No historical approval is converted into fresh full-UC acceptance.

## Documentation verification

- [x] Six synchronization tasks complete; code-derived deltas D01–D14 addressed, additional D15 key reveal recorded.
- [x] Current Markdown links, OpenAPI parse/local references/operation IDs/path parameters, draw.io XML/page consistency, 12 refreshed PNG exports and visual inspection.
- [x] Independent read-only review findings corrected; source application/config/DB unchanged.
- [ ] Fresh application/runtime/provider/security/performance/restore acceptance remains pending; no such success claimed.

[Sync report](construction/build-and-test/2026-10-30-documentation-sync-report.md).

## Rule/use-case/test audit — 2026-10-30

- [x] Read assertions/fixtures and code for all15units, with per-UC evidence/gap rows in three appendices.
- [x] Fresh backend1372pass/99skip; frontend597pass/94files after restoring locked dependencies. No source/manifest/lockfile changes.
- [x] Subsequent remediation ran all backend cases: 1,611 passed/0 skipped; required PostgreSQL guard passed. The earlier 1,372/99 audit run remains historical.
- [x] Approved U03 P1 fixes, false-positive fixtures, scoped missing assertions, current BR/UC drift and Student/Admin MCP correction implemented and verified. Broader acceptance gaps remain explicit in the remediation report.

[Consolidated audit](construction/build-and-test/2026-10-30-unit-test-business-rule-audit.md). Passing suites do not certify full business-rule/UC acceptance.

## Remediation closure — 2026-10-30

[Results and practical limits](construction/build-and-test/2026-10-30-remediation-student-mcp-results.md). Backend 1,611 pass/0 skip; frontend 599 pass/94 files; required DB guard, lint/typecheck/build passed. BF-06/BF-08 exports inspected. Migration tested in disposable databases only. No commit/push/live migration/deploy.
