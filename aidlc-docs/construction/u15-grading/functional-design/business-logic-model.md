# U15 Grading & Gradebook — business-logic-model

> Current Construction revision 2026-10-13: 66 active UC, 50 MVP stories + 1 extension, 15 logical units. Đồng bộ theo Inception, chỉ sửa tài liệu; chưa triển khai/kiểm runtime hoặc duyệt stage/code mới. Approval/checklist trước revision thuộc lịch sử.

**Primary UC:** 42, 43, 44, 45. **Primary stories:** US-GRP-006, US-GRD-001, US-GRD-002, US-GRD-003, US-GRD-004, US-GRD-005, US-INT-001. **Requirements:** FR-008/009/020/039.

## Luồng xử lý

- Submission event → register scope/snapshot → teacher manual or selected-source AI request → validate proposal/rubric → teacher confirms → finalize → publish event.
- Student view grade only published own; teacher export/Gradebook official Assignments only via U16.
- UC42 activity tab → authorize → U11 scoped query → display known intervals/gaps; no grade mutation or verdict automation.

## Public contracts

proposal validation; manual evaluation; finalize/publish/history/gradebook; reviewWorkActivity(authorizedTeacher, attempt/member) within UC 42 via U11 ActivityQueryPort

## Invariants và failure

- UC42 submissions/work detail plus activity review assigned teacher R3/R4. Admin or manager only R2 denied. Quiz Practice activity read does not create Gradebook.
- Only human teacher confirms Assignment GRADED official result, finalizes/publishes. AI proposal separate PENDING/READY/ACCEPTED/REJECTED, never automatically final/publish.
- Rubric scores deterministic by checklist/max, linked submission/rubric version; proposal stale if submission changed. Manual override requires reason/audit; batch finalize rejects/informs invalid rows, no silent grading.
- Practice Quiz scorer and Assignment feedback not official; answer reveal follows snapshot policy; Student own published official grades only.
- Group common document score + manual contribution adjustment, bounded and explained; activity/number edits cannot determine contribution or cheating score automatically.
- ActivityQueryPort U11 projection per member/work, after current class/policy check; disabled/no data/unavailable distinct. Does not mutate grading entities from telemetry.
- Authorization current actor/resource on every web/API/MCP call, fail closed; CSRF protections for cookie-session state-changing routes; no user-supplied actor trusted.
- expectedVersion on edits and idempotency on repeatable commands/events; conflicts do not overwrite current state, retry bounded, reference returned not secrets.
- Unit repository private; cross-unit read/write through public ports. DB ownership is logical within one Spring Boot monolith; no 15 service deploys.
- No fabricated survey/implementation evidence. D01 Quiz Practice, D02 Group Graded, D03 own-editable group AI context retained provisionally; numeric quota D04 and backup/activity retention require settings confirmation.

## Kiểm nghiệm

- Admin/R2-only denied; stale proposal reject; AI cannot publish/finalize via REST/MCP; unpublished grade hidden.
- Quiz Practice stays outside Gradebook; group adjustment bounds/audit; activity viewing never changes grade; masked missing intervals.
